# ApplePickerPrototype:
This is a prototype for a 2d game where you have to catch apples in the baskets. The baskets are moved by moving your mouse left and right. After an apple drops below the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life (a basket) and the level starts over. After the player reaches level 3, the game reaches an endless mode until the player runs out of lives. Then the player is sent to the end game screen. The high score is stored using playerprefs.
